• Discussing requirements
• Release planning is important to what we are going to start planning first
• Diagrams must be done with a program
• What do we want to use for our diagramming tool?
    • Lucid chart? → evaluate if it looks good
• Do we UC the entire app? 
    • 4-5 UC and tests to pair it up
    • Test user's whole transition through the app
    • Does he want tests for a use case in terms of code? 
    • Have a plan of which objects you'll make and have tests for them
• We need to know what objects we are making, how the app is going to work
• Drivers can be passengers
    • User → driver
    • User → passenger
        • You'd have to have separate accounts to do this
        • Or two login pages
• You have to search by location or keyword to get a driver?
    • Driver has to be able to see when a new request shows up, then the passenger has to confirm

1.) In requests... notified if ride is accepted
    • Pop up window in app, that takes you to another activity?
    • Once they start the activity that they want to be picked up
        • Has view that updates every 30s to show available drivers and then select
        • Driver has an offer window, and that will show "Offer made" or "Offer accepted"
