• What did we do last week: 
    • Most people looking at part 1
    • Some people work on part 2
    • Storm is doing storyboard with Kirsty
        • Have rough sketch, but need to make something nice looking
        • Don't have mock up, clarifying what needs to be done
        • Need diagram of main user dialogs
    • Have pretty much whole layout for driver, but no transition
    • Just make it obvious to click somewhere (mark it somehow e.g. with a yellow box)
    • Storm has no blockers:
• Marco: 
    • Working on part 1 unit tests
    • No blockers
• Mackenzie: 
    • Blockers: wednesday
    • Part 1 unit tests 
    • Use cases 
• Beardless justin:
    • Writing use cases 

Kirsty: 
• Storyboard
• Help with tests if time allows
• Blockers: assignment due friday



• Part 3 is a UML, how are you allocating your user stories across the time you're given
    • How to allocate when things get done
    
• Will hammer out 3&4 on thursday'
__Talking with TA__
• Do user stories follow the card format on eclass?
• Should follow the slides format
• Similar content, just more formal
• 1 Test per action
• For the user story to be satisfied, the app must provide functionality
• But you can test separtely
• Later you can add a GUI test 
• Break up your tests into several pieces
• Once GUI is established, do tests
• Do tests such that they're runnable, but they don't have to be runnable
• Tests should show your intent to do something 
    • But you don't need the code to back it up 
• Mock tests, you'll need empty classes to make them runnable
    • Make new empty classes as needed
• Will help you figure out how to do stuff
• Must keep stuff synchonized everywhere (UML, storyboard, code)
• Don't write tests very verbosely
    • Make them available for revision/be a bit vague, especially right now
• User reqs take a long time, but there shouldn't be any catches

• For each user story, each person must write out the use case and tests for each story


• Justin has UC 1-6
• Marco has 7-12
• Mack has 13-18
